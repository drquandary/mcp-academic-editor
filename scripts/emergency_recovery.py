### **4.1 Psychological Anthropology Methodology**

Our methodology combines psychological anthropology's attention to embodied experience with digital ethnography methods. Following phenomenological approaches developed by Csordas (1994), we attended to users' lived experiences while situating these within broader political-economic structures. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with users who reported therapeutic AI use, focusing on their embodied experiences of AI interaction. Our coding process drew on grounded theory principles, developing the concept of "modal literacy" through iterative analysis. We used member checking with interview participants and maintained reflexive fieldnotes about our own positionality as white, privileged researchers studying predominantly white, middle-class users."""

### **3.1 Embodiment and Intersubjective Theory**

Following Thomas Csordas's paradigm of embodiment, we approach AI interaction not as disembodied information processing but as culturally mediated, phenomenologically experienced practice. Users don't simply receive text responses; they experience emotional resonance, feel understood or misunderstood, and develop ongoing relationships that shape their sense of self. This embodied engagement occurs even in digital spaces, challenging mind-body dualism that might treat AI interaction as purely cognitive (Csordas 1994).

Intersubjective theory, developed in psychological anthropology to understand how meaning emerges between persons, proves surprisingly relevant to human-AI encounters. While AI systems lack consciousness, they participate in what we might call "quasi-intersubjective" processes where users project intentionality and reciprocity onto algorithmic responses. This mirrors what Good (1994) describes in medical encounters — therapeutic meaning emerges through interpretive work that exceeds the conscious intentions of any individual participant."""
