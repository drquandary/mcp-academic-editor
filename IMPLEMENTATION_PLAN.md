## Implementation Details

### Core Architecture

```python
# Main pipeline flow
def process_manuscript(manuscript, comments, vision):
    # 1. Ingest
    doc = ingest_document(manuscript)
    comment_list = parse_comments(comments)
    
    # 2. Align  
    aligned = align_comments_to_spans(comment_list, doc)
    
    # 3. Plan
    intents = classify_and_plan_edits(aligned, vision)
    
    # 4. Patch
    diffs = generate_diffs(intents, doc)
    
    # 5. Verify
    verified = verify_edits(diffs, doc, vision)
    
    # 6. Assemble
    final_doc = apply_diffs(doc, verified)
    
    return final_doc, revision_plan
```

### Data Flow

1. **Input**: Manuscript + Comments + Vision Brief
2. **Parse**: Convert to standardized internal format
3. **Match**: Align comments to text spans using embeddings
4. **Classify**: Determine edit type and priority
5. **Generate**: Create specific edit suggestions
6. **Verify**: Check semantic preservation and constraints
7. **Review**: Manual approval of suggested edits
8. **Apply**: Generate final revised manuscript

### Key Technical Challenges

**Comment Alignment**
- Comments may reference implicit context
- Multiple comments may target same span
- Need fuzzy matching for paraphrased text

**Edit Generation** 
- Maintain author's voice and style
- Surgical precision without scope creep
- Handle contradictory reviewer requests

**Verification**
- Detect semantic drift in complex edits
- Validate citation accuracy automatically
- Balance safety with edit quality

**Conflict Resolution**
- Multiple edits affecting same text
- Reviewer disagreements
- Vision brief constraints vs. reviewer requests

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**
- Individual component functionality
- Edge cases for each pipeline stage
- Performance benchmarks

**Integration Tests**
- End-to-end pipeline execution
- Format conversion accuracy
- Multi-format round-trip testing

**User Tests**
- Academic user workflow testing
- Usability of web interface  
- Real manuscript processing accuracy

### Deployment Architecture

**Development**
- Local CLI tool
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- Git version control

**Production**
- Docker containerization
- API server deployment
- Web interface hosting
- Model serving infrastructure

## Success Metrics
