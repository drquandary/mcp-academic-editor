# MCP Academic Editor

**Surgical manuscript editing with word count protection via Model Context Protocol**

A sophisticated academic manuscript revision system that provides surgical, line-anchored editing tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Designed specifically for researchers who need precise manuscript revisions while maintaining word count requirements and semantic integrity.

## üîí Critical Safety Features

**Word Count Protection Guarantee**: This system will NEVER reduce your manuscript below 95% of its original word count. All edits are designed to augment and enhance your work, not replace or delete content.

- ‚úÖ **Augmentation Mode**: Prefers additions over replacements
- ‚úÖ **Word Count Verification**: Blocks edits that would reduce word count significantly  
- ‚úÖ **Emergency Recovery**: Built-in backup and recovery mechanisms
- ‚úÖ **Semantic Preservation**: Maintains your core thesis and claims
- ‚úÖ **Journal Compliance**: Enforces minimum word count requirements (configurable, default 8000)

## üöÄ Key Features

### Intelligent Document Processing
- **Universal Format Support**: Markdown (.md), Word (.docx), LaTeX (.tex), and PDF
- **Automatic Structure Detection**: Identifies sections, paragraphs, and citation patterns
- **Comment Integration**: Processes reviewer comments from any format (plain text, JSON, files)

### Surgical Editing Engine
- **Line-Anchored Diffs**: Precise edits that preserve document structure
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles overlapping edit suggestions intelligently
- **Span-Based Reconstruction**: Maintains formatting and cross-references

### Semantic Safety
- **Vision Brief Integration**: Preserves your core thesis and key claims
- **Protected Sections**: Mark sections as untouchable during revision
- **Verification Pipeline**: Multi-layer checks before applying any changes

## Core Philosophy

- **Thesis Preservation**: Never compromise the core argument
- **Surgical Precision**: Make minimal, targeted changes

```python
# Process peer review feedback
vision = VisionBrief(
    thesis="Your core argument here",
    claims=["Key claim 1", "Key claim 2"],
    do_not_change=["Methodology", "Results"]
)

editor = AcademicEditor()
result = editor.process_manuscript(
    "draft.md", 
    "peer_review.pdf",  # Automatically extracts comments
    vision
)

print(f"Applied {len(result.applied_edits)} surgical edits")
print(f"Preserved thesis: {result.verification.thesis_preserved}")
```

### Multi-Reviewer Integration
```python
# Handle multiple reviewer files
reviewer_sources = [
    "reviewer1_comments.docx",
    "reviewer2_feedback.txt", 
    "reviewer3_suggestions.json"
]

for source in reviewer_sources:
    result = editor.process_manuscript("manuscript.md", source, vision)
    editor.merge_results(result)
```

### Diff-Style Editing
```python
# Process git-style diffs
diff_comments = """
@@ -120,3 +120,5 @@ methodology section

+However, we acknowledge limitations in sample diversity.
+Future work should address these constraints.
"""

result = editor.process_manuscript("paper.md", diff_comments, vision)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Word Count Issues
If you experience word count reduction:

1. **Check Safety Settings**: Ensure `augment_only_mode: true`
2. **Use Emergency Recovery**: Run `scripts/emergency_recovery.py`
3. **Review Operation Types**: Verify edits use "expand" not "replace"

### Claude Desktop Connection Issues
```bash
# Test the MCP server
python3 scripts/test_mcp_connection.py

# Validate configuration
python3 tests/test_mcp_connection.py
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure PYTHONPATH is set correctly
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/mcp-academic-editor:$PYTHONPATH"
```

### Python Path Issues
If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp'`:

1. **Check your Python installation**:
   ```bash
   which python3
   python3 -c "import mcp; print('MCP installed')"
   ```

2. **Update Claude Desktop config** with the correct Python path:
   ```json
   "command": "/full/path/to/python3"
   ```

3. **Install MCP in the right environment**:
   ```bash
   # If using conda
   conda install -c conda-forge mcp
   
   # If using pip
   pip install mcp fastmcp
   ```
