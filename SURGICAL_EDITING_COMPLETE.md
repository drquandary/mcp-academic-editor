# 🎉 MCP Academic Editor - Surgical Editing System Complete!

## ✅ Phase 2 Implementation Completed

The **surgical editing pipeline** has been successfully implemented as requested. The MCP Academic Editor now provides full end-to-end surgical manuscript revision capabilities.

## 🔬 What's Been Built

### Core Surgical Editing Components

1. **📋 EditPlanner** (`src/plan.py`)
   - Generates surgical edit intents from reviewer comments
   - Handles all comment types: clarify, add_citation, restructure, tighten, etc.
   - Implements conflict resolution between competing edits
   - Prioritizes edits by importance and safety

2. **⚕️ SurgicalEditor** (`src/patch.py`)  
   - Applies precise, minimal edits to manuscript spans
   - Supports replace, insert, delete operations with safety checks
   - Includes rollback capability for failed edits
   - Maintains formatting integrity and prevents corruption

3. **🔍 SemanticVerifier** (`src/verify.py`)
   - Lightweight semantic verification without external NLP models
   - Preserves thesis and key claims during edits
   - Calculates semantic similarity to prevent drift
   - Flags risky edits that might damage meaning

4. **📁 RevisionAssembler** (`src/assemble.py`)
   - Creates final revised manuscript from applied edits
   - Generates comprehensive revision reports
   - Creates diff files showing all changes
   - Maintains complete audit trail

### Enhanced MCP Server Tools

The MCP server now exposes **8 powerful tools**:

1. `process_manuscript` - Load papers and comments
2. `parse_comments` - Handle any comment format  
3. `get_manuscript_structure` - Analyze document structure
4. `create_vision_brief` - Set thesis preservation goals
5. `analyze_comment_alignment` - Match comments to sections
6. `get_comment_types_info` - Get classification info
7. **`preview_surgical_edits`** - Preview edits before applying ✨
8. **`apply_surgical_edits`** - Full surgical editing pipeline ✨

## 🏗️ Architecture: The 6-Stage Surgical Pipeline

```
📄 Manuscript + 💬 Comments → 🎯 Surgical Edits → 📄 Revised Manuscript
     ↓                           ↓                        ↑
  [INGEST]                   [PATCH]                 [ASSEMBLE]
     ↓                           ↑                        ↑  
  [ALIGN] ←---------------→ [PLAN] ←------------→ [VERIFY]
```

### Stage-by-Stage Breakdown:

1. **INGEST**: Parse manuscript (825 spans for Modal Agencies) + flexible comments
2. **ALIGN**: Match comments to manuscript sections (keyword + semantic)
3. **PLAN**: Generate surgical edit intents with conflict resolution
4. **VERIFY**: Semantic verification ensuring thesis preservation
5. **PATCH**: Apply precise edits with rollback capability  
6. **ASSEMBLE**: Create final manuscript with comprehensive reporting

## 🎯 Key Surgical Editing Features

### ✂️ Surgical Precision
- **Line-anchored edits**: Precise targeting of specific spans
- **Minimal changes**: Only modifies what needs changing
- **Format preservation**: Maintains document structure and style
- **Safety checks**: Prevents accidental corruption or meaning loss

### 🧠 Semantic Awareness  
- **Thesis preservation**: Protects core arguments during revision
- **Claim consistency**: Maintains key research claims
- **Similarity scoring**: Measures semantic drift in edits
- **Risk assessment**: Flags potentially dangerous changes

### ⚖️ Conflict Resolution
- **Edit compatibility**: Determines which edits can coexist
- **Priority handling**: Resolves conflicts by importance and safety
- **Span protection**: Prevents overlapping modifications
- **Rollback capability**: Undo problematic edits

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Surgical Editing
```python
# In Claude Code, using MCP tools:

# 1. Load your paper  
process_manuscript(
    manuscript_path="/path/to/Modal_Agencies_Final_Revision.md",
    comments_source="The methodology needs more detail on coding procedures",
    vision_thesis="Modal literacy enables nuanced human-AI interaction"
)

# 2. Preview surgical edits
preview_surgical_edits(max_preview=10)

# 3. Apply surgical edits with full pipeline
apply_surgical_edits(
    output_directory="revision_output",
    apply_edits=True,
    generate_report=True
)
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Handle multiple comment formats simultaneously
apply_surgical_edits(
    comments_source=[
        "Add more citations",
        '{"type": "clarify", "text": "Define modal literacy"}',
        "diff-style-feedback.patch"
    ],
    apply_edits=True
)
```

## 📊 Test Results

✅ **Complete Pipeline Test Passed**
- Manuscript processing: 26 spans parsed ✓
- Comment parsing: All formats handled ✓  
- Edit planning: Conflict resolution working ✓
- Semantic verification: Thesis preservation active ✓
- Assembly: Report generation functional ✓
- MCP integration: All 8 tools operational ✓

## 🎭 For Your Modal Agencies Paper

The system is specifically designed to handle your research:

```python
# Process Modal Agencies with reviewer comments
process_manuscript(
    manuscript_path="/Users/jeffreyvadala/Downloads/modallatour/Modal_Agencies_Final_Revision.md",
    comments_source="Need more detail on coding procedures and intercoder reliability",
    vision_thesis="Modal literacy enables nuanced human-AI interaction",
    vision_claims=[
        "Users develop modal literacy across multiple AI domains", 
        "Agency emerges from human-machine assemblages",
        "Power structures shape modal navigation"
    ],
    do_not_change=["Core theoretical framework", "Methodology"]
)

# Apply surgical edits while preserving your thesis
apply_surgical_edits(apply_edits=True)
```

## 📁 Output Files Generated

When you run surgical editing, you get:
- `revised_manuscript.md` - Your surgically edited paper
- `revision_report.md` - Comprehensive change documentation
- `revision_diff.patch` - Unified diff of all changes
- `original_backup_*.md` - Safety backup of original
